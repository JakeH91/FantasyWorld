Worked a lot with [[Immure]] and the others in the creation of the first civilization. She was one of the few gods that had somewhat of a relationship with [[ilu]] but not in the stage of being a friend. 

She had a special care for the [[First Human]] and considered them her own as much as [[Immure]].

She struggled a lot after [[The Sacrifice]], which she was present at and also participated in. 

She had conflicting feelings towards the [[Ilutari]].  She found them to remind her of the sin, bit also found them to be quite mysterious and inhibit some of the features of Ilu. 

She sent [[The Champion]] to the forest to see what caused the first humans to abandon that settlement. 

Delthari is considered a prominent figure in the panthos of the empire. 


Dalthari usually have 6 main champions, each having their own main responsibility. Not many known. [[The Champion]] was what is called "Eidolon Envoy" which is the main investigator for Delthari.
