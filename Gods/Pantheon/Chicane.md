Formed in a great lake, Chicane saw the other gods getting to work creating life. This seemed like more work than Chicane would like, so he deceived [[Immure]] into temporarily leaving his creation (the humans) before they had learned of their creator. Chicane then imprisoned Immure deep in his great lake, and took on the role of the humans creator. He was worshipped as the creator right up until [[The Magic Academy]], when Immure was freed.

This did not, however, stop the humans from worshipping him. And for the rest of history, humans divided themselves; those who worshipped Chicane, and those who worshipped Immure. During the times of The Empire, Chicane was once again able to deceive the humans into worshipping only him, and The Empire decreed that Immure was a false creator.
