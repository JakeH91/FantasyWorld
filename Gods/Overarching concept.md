The overarching concept of gods

Question: 
Do they have their own domain? 
- If so
	- do all gods have their own domain? 
	- What is a domain?
	- Can normal people access the domain?

What is the source of gods powers?
- Magic?
- Something else?

Should there be one unified pantheon? In my ideas-list, I have one "God of Nature". But cant there be multiple god of nature? Maybe we do not need them to be specific realm wise (justice, nature etc), but more based on personality? And then have some few that are very specific? 

Maybe they aren't really gods of anything, exactly. They have things they like to focus on, but that can be varied. It is the mortals that give them the titles, so the "God of Nature" that you talked about could be "God of Growth" to some mortals, but "God of Decay" to others. And maybe there are multiple gods working on for example health, but to some mortals they believe it is just one "God of Health".
So really, these mighty, powerful beings have many interests, but mortal minds crave simplicity and therefore label things less complexly than they really are.
