The overarching concept of gods

Question: 
Do they have their own domain? 
- Of so
	- do all gods have their own domain? 
	- What is a domain?
	- Can normal people access the domain?

What is the source of gods powers?
- Magic?
- Something else?


Should there be one unified pantheon? In my ideas-list, I have one "God of Nature". But cant there be multiple god of nature? Maybe we do not need them to be specific realm wise (justice, nature etc), but more based on personality? And then have some few that are very specific?
