The following account serves as the official history of the expeditions 
that commenced during the early stages of the empire and have persisted up to the present day. 

These expeditions stand as a testament to the empire's strength and intelligence, showcasing remarkable feats in engineering, navigation, documentation, military prowess, and more. At the time of this writing, there have been 25 expeditions. What follows is a detailed, to the best of our ability, description of each of them. 

The first two expeditions, being the oldest, are the easiest to document due to their nature, focusing on exploring the main continent. The initial expedition followed a southern and eastern route, while the second took a western and northern path. 

From the third to the seventh Expedition, it becomes increasingly challenging to provide detailed accounts. The third was the first expedition to venture to another continent, and notably, no members of this expedition returned to the capital. The challenges of exploring other continents were also evident in the fourth, sixth, and seventh expeditions. The fifth expedition aimed to explore the devastation, resulting in significant loss of documentation. 

The eighth expedition was dedicated to locating the third expedition. Upon finding the empty ship with no signs of its members, a substantial overhaul of documentation standardization and increased focus on military presence were initiated for subsequent expeditions. This initiative has, with a few exceptions (notably the eleventh and fourteenth), proven to be a major success. 

This tome is intended to describe each expedition, relying on documentation, diaries, and, in some cases, interviews.
