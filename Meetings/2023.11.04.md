NOTES (2023.02.29):

- Wanted to start in January with the group that we actually are going to be with
- "I can still use DnD" - nope. I think we've now decided on Basic Role Playing (BRP)
- Discuss the original idea for the dnd concept
	- Set just as the Wars of Ruin are about to begin. They live in a privileged life, until the Colossi rise.
	- The idea was for the players to try to figure out where these Colossi came from, and trying to protect their city. Would help us figure out exactly what happens during this war?
	- They are sent to another city that they have lost contact with, so they teleport there and boom, the whole city has been annihilated
- At this point, we had no idea what happened *before* the Wars of Ruin. "Were there even humans civilised at this point?"
- Mentioned some floating cities that I'm not sure are canon anymore
- A magic pact was signed after the Wars of Ruin
