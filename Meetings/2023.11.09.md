NOTES (2023.02.29):

- Arild discusses his [[Short stories/Ancestral Bonds/Timeline|Timeline]]
	- The storylines in his story should seem like they are happening at the same time, but they are actually not. That unravels as you read the story.
	- The guy with the baby, the baby will be the sister
	- The sister is the main point of view, who is adopted
	- They live in a fancy villa that is defended by the ministry of purity
	- Something happens with the father, politically, so the guard helps to protect them by giving the daughter to a more wealthy family
	- The librarian, artisan, and anarchist (LAaA) discover some plot that involves the father and his daughters. It's them that warns them of the danger.
	- The Empire is built up of guilds, there are four that become the most powerful (The Founding). Before these four, there were many, and they acted as city states, but then something happens (the meeting of the four) which changes the entire empire.
	- You must rise through the guilds, through the ranks, to be leader of any individual guild.
	- Perhaps there is an individual that exists in the empire that wants to change this to a system that is inherited, so his offspring take over from him, so he has to find a reason why *his* line is important enough to rule. He starts to purge other lines that he considers a threat, to make his bloodline the only legitimate bloodline
	- Perhaps this could be spun in such a way that makes his bloodline seem the strongest, like "look, all the other ones are dying, but not mine".
		- Yes but maybe also it's super obvious that he is the one doing it, so need to figure out what his argument he uses in public, to justify this purge.
		- So either it's very public, and he has to have a reason, or he's doing it in private, and he needs a reason as to why it *isn't* happening to his family. Killing people in his own bloodline could make him seem more innocent.
		- What can he base his power on? Maybe that he is connected to a god, or the first humans.
		- The sister has a very unique bloodline that is strong both of humans and first humans.
	- He wants to get rid of the sister because she has an important human bloodline, but maybe she has an important First Human bloodline too.
	- The librarian starts noticing lots of executions, but they seem like random names, but he wants to figure out the connection.
