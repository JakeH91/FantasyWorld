In fantasy, they normally make a division between hard and soft magic

Hard: Magic follows clear established rules that the readers know about. In other words, they understand why Harry Potter cant just use a spell in the start to just destroy V

Soft: The rules of magic is unkown, and is not clearly described. For example, in Lord of the Rings, magic is not clearly explained, so we do not really know how much gandalf can actually do

This is a spectrum

So, what would our magic system look like? Should it be detailed and explained (like almost a science), or more loosly established and mysterius. 

For me, I think I lean more to the latter. I think establishing clear rules about the magic system is tricky, and could also restrict us. But. open to hear what you think
