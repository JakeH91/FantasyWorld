In fantasy, they normally make a division between hard and soft magic

Hard: Magic follows clear established rules that the readers know about. In other words, they understand why Harry Potter cant just use a spell in the start to just destroy Voldemort

Soft: The rules of magic is unknown, and is not clearly described. For example, in Lord of the Rings, magic is not clearly explained, so we do not really know how much gandalf can actually do

This is a spectrum

So, what would our magic system look like? Should it be detailed and explained (like almost a science), or more loosly established and mysterious. 

For me, I think I lean more to the latter. I think establishing clear rules about the magic system is tricky, and could also restrict us. But. open to hear what you think

We could have an approach in which there are different forms of magic, and some of them are more known and understood, while others are more mysterious and not clearly defined. Could create a sense of intrigue and wonder when exploring different magic
