Deep underground, it floatsâ€”the enigmatic heart of Kall's labyrinth. This was his ultimate and solitary creation, a cube with six edges of pure black metal. The intricacy and magic woven into this construct were so profound that no living being could endure its presence for long. Many believes that it exist at the very core of the planet, tapping into the mystical metal unique to that place, rendering teleportation feasible. In an earlier era, the art of navigating the labyrinth had been among the noblest and most challenging of professions. Only those possessing a high level of magical aptitude and a profound connection with Kall himself could serve as guides through its intricate passages. However, following the fall of Kall, the connection was severed, rendering teleportation within the labyrinth an impossible feat.
