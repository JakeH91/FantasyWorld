West on the peninsula in which the Empire started, there is the Desolation, also called the purple desert. One of the most hostile regions of the world, with unstable weather and extreme desert-area. 
Set in-between a continuous mountain range, with only three main openings. These three openings are called the "gates of Desolation", and here the desolations arm are stretched out from the barriers of the mountain range, to touch the more fertile and functioning earth. 

Inside the desolation, there is no known water source, and the shifting of purple dust, making navigation incredible difficult. 

Consequently, the desolation was early on an effective barrier for further expansion for the empire. Leading it to focus elsewhere, then expanding further west. However, after the fall of the [[The Guild Assembly]] the empire started to look west-ward. The Empire funded the [[The Desolation Expedition]], an ambitious project to map the Desolation and try to map out a safe passage between the east and the west Gates of Desolation. A proper map of the whole Desolation was not established, however, a road of stone was put down from the east to the west, marked with huge poles. Even when the sand covered the road, the poles would be seen, and you could safely walk next to them knowing there were no siking-sand there. 

This road, called the west passage, made it so the empire could reach over the desolation and continue its expansion
