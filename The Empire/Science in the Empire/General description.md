**Science**

In the capital of the empire, there stands a prestigious institution known as the **Grand Academy of Scholars**. This venerable establishment serves as the heart of intellectual pursuit and scientific advancement within the empire. It is here that all scholarly works are carefully reviewed, cataloged, and approved, ensuring the highest standards of knowledge and research.

**The Process of Citation and the Assignment of Identifiers**

When an author or scientist creates a new work—be it a treatise on alchemy, a study on magical theory, or a comprehensive guide to potion-making—they must submit it to the Grand Academy for official review. A panel of esteemed experts, each a master in their respective fields, scrutinizes the work to verify its authenticity, accuracy, and contribution to the body of knowledge. Only after a rigorous review process does the work receive the coveted **Seal of Scholarly Approval**, marking the author as an officially recognized scholar within the empire.

Once a work is approved, it is assigned a **unique identifier**—a special code that serves as a reference for citation and recognition throughout the empire. This identifier is meticulously crafted using the following format:

1. **Science Identifier**: A single letter representing the field of science (e.g., **A** for Alchemy, **M** for Magic, **P** for Potions, etc.).
2. **Author's Initials**: The first letters of the author's first and last name.
3. **Title Code**: The initial letters of key words from the title of the work.
4. **Year of Publication**: The last two digits of the year in which the work was published.

For example, consider a work on alchemy authored by Eleanor Smith, titled "The Chronicles of Eldoria," and published in the year 1220. The identifier for this work would be: **A-ES-CE-20**.

**The Annex of Acknowledgments**

Every three years, the Grand Academy publishes an **Annex of Acknowledgments**. This comprehensive document is a revered resource, listing all the identifiers of approved works, along with detailed information such as the author's name, the year of publication, and the names of the scholars who reviewed the piece. The Annex serves not only as a catalog of knowledge but also as a testament to the contributions of the empire's greatest minds.

Owning a copy of the Annex is essential for any scholar or institution wishing to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and recognized works. Without access to the Annex, the true identifiers and their associated works would remain unknown, making it a highly sought-after resource.

**The Path to Scholarship and Funding**

Becoming an approved scholar of the Grand Academy is a prestigious honor that comes with tangible benefits. Upon receiving the Seal of Scholarly Approval, a scholar is granted a **scholarship**—a modest but sufficient stipend to support their research and daily needs for a period of five to ten years. This funding ensures that scholars can dedicate themselves fully to their studies without the distraction of financial concerns.

However, this support is not indefinite. To maintain their status and continue receiving funding, scholars must produce new, significant works of research or discovery before the end of their scholarship term. The competition to remain approved and funded is fierce, driving many to push the boundaries of their fields in pursuit of knowledge and recognition.

**The Drive for Recognition**

The Grand Academy's system has created a thriving intellectual community within the empire, filled with passionate individuals striving to make their mark. The promise of funding, recognition, and the honor of being listed in the Annex of Acknowledgments motivates countless scholars to seek approval, innovate, and contribute to the empire's vast tapestry of knowledge.

Whether driven by a quest for truth, the desire for recognition, or the need to secure their livelihood, scholars across the empire tirelessly work to advance their fields, ensuring that the spirit of inquiry and discovery remains alive and well in the heart of the empire.
