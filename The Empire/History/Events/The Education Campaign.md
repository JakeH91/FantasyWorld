The education campaign is an ongoing policy in the empire. In the year XXX, the Empire had stretched over massive area, and also over many different cultures. In the assembly, the issue was on how they empire could keep the whole area under control and stable. 

A formal committee was set-up to explore different solutions, and its costs. Lead by the famous strategist ......, the committee came up with two major solution: one military, and one cultural. 

The first was to establish control through expansion of the military, with setting up military bases all around. This required a massive military presence for many years to come. 

The second approach, was one with education. Many areas lacked educational system. Consequently, the empire could fund and build up functioning educational system, and require every child from 10-16 to go through this. This would then be billed as developing the region they occupied. Short-term, therefore it could buy them important alliances in the area. More long-term though, this was specific attractive. The Empire could design the things being thought in the school, especially around religion, history, and culture. In other words, this was a long-term solution to assimilate into the empire. 

The decision was on the education campaign. 

The empire set-up massive schools to develop teachers, and then these were sent out into the areas that they needed. They were sent out together with others, like military presence, and other services, like healing sorcerers from the magic academy. 

The curriculum were designed in such a way to make sure it was the Empires stories that were told. Especially focus were also given to "break up historical and primitive hierarchies", and especially on the fact that "young were not under their parents or family". Under the campaign, young boys and girls were put into specific learning groups, and there was an establishment of identity of each group using experiences from the military to develop a sense of identity inside each corp. This was to prevent particular strong individuals and group to question the education. Talking up against the education would be seen as a direct attack on the group, the community, and individuals that had young ones in the school, would not speak up in case the group would announce a "hierarchy purging" (meaning, the kid had told on the parents that they were talking bad about the education, making it so this was a question to break the hierarchy between them). 

The success of the education campaign was incredible. Regional hierarchical purging happened frequently (especially the 1st purging of...., and the 5th purging of .....) , and the empire got new generations of citizens that considered themselves part of the empire, more then anything else. 

Magic were forgotten, gods put into slumper, and cultures extinct. However the success were not total. Regional groupings were established to make sure knowledge were not completely forgotten. In the year xxxx three regional groups met, and the establishment of the Restoration was a fact.
