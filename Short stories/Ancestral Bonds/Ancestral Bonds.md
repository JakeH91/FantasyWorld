## Prologue

Though there is no definitive evidence of what occurred, stories abound about their fate. The tales tell of them delving deeper and deeper into the unknown, until they vanished from sight. The motivation to escape the accursed realm and the persecution of their kind likely prompted their departure from the city. 

[[Kadwan]], "City of Mystery"

## Chapter 1

Time had blurred since he last experienced proper daylight, his decision to enter the ancient city carved into the hillside haunting him. The choice had been forced by relentless pursuers, soldiers closing in. What had appeared as the only escape route had spiraled into an unimaginable nightmare. With exhaustion and thirst gnawing at him, each step was a test of endurance. The thought of finding water or a safe place to rest were once pressing concerns, but now they felt like distant echoes. Even the presence stalking him was beginning to lose its terror, numbed by fatigue and fear.

With the wind's direction constantly changing, any hope of finding his way back to the sea faded. He moved forward slowly, a defeated soul navigating the intricate streets of the carved rock city.
After some time had passed, an overwhelming sense of exhaustion prompted him to halt his progress. Though he was aware that his search had only just begun, it felt like an eternity. This time, instead of seeking refuge in the carved houses and caves that lined the streets, he gave in to his fatigue, collapsing right there on the street. As he lay there, memories of his lush farm and the promise of spring flooded his thoughts. He vividly recalled the hope he had felt after a calm winter, with fertile soil promising a bountiful harvest.

His thoughts turned to his child, who had begun exploring the world around her, taking her first steps. Her innocent face brought warmth to his heart. From the darkness, a voice emerged, low and gruff, asking, "Are you ready?" Without hesitation, he responded with a smile, "Yes." A shadowy presence descended, like a looming cloud. Darkness intensified, swallowing everything until there was nothing left.



"Are you coming?" she shouted upstairs, frustration lining her voice. Another late start, she sighed inwardly. "I'm coming," came the response. From the dimly lit staircase, she watched her sister slowly descend. "We have to be early, you know!" she admonished. "I know, I know," her sister replied, a hint of exasperation in her voice. Lately, they'd been missing their departure time. The Imperial fleet always secured the best spots, leaving the rest as a desperate scramble against the clock. Their recent tardiness meant they only managed to reach the fringes of the [[Coldfish]] stream, catching barely enough for a fortnight. It's insufficient, she mused. We need at least ten times that to tide us over. The next [[Coldfish]] wave wouldn't arrive for another three months.


Once again, they found themselves arriving late. However, luck was on their side as two boats had become entangled in a dispute, creating an opening for them to row in. "Fantastic! Now we can access the stream!" they exclaimed. The following hours proved incredible as they managed to secure enough fish to last until the next opportunity. Drifting with the current, they ended up in their usual spot next to the statue, where the fish always disappeared. "That city gives me the creeps," the sister shivered, glancing up at the Cliff-side. "I know," she agreed. Suddenly, the sister pointed. "Look! They're still there!" Just outside one of the entrances, soldiers lined up, observing the ships. "It's so strange," she mused. "They've been there for a week now, not moving at all. I wonder what they're doing."



It was yet another morning, the fifth day in that place. He stretched his legs and walked to the edge for a moment of privacy. What a waste of time this was, he thought. Gazing out over the water, he inhaled a lungful of fresh air, realizing how long it had been since they'd been out in the field.

In the past, the elite of the purging units, skilled in a variety of areas rather than specializing in a specific field, were dispatched to handle the most obscure and uncertain situation. But now, they were stuck in a monotonous routine. Nothing particularly dangerous had come up lately. Usually, it was just unstable magic users, a task that the regular purging units could handle. Their current assignments seemed to be about preventing them from succumbing to boredom. 

However, this time was different. A high-level call had summoned them. He wasn't sure exactly how high up it came from, but it was deemed serious. To his surprise, the mission turned out to be targeting a farmer. "Ah, even those that appear significant are not exempt," he mused


He tidied his table, preparing for another bustling day. Placing crates of books on display, he knew that his profits could greatly vary. Occasionally, a book would become the city's sensation, and in such cases, maintaining a strong connection with the printer was crucial. Being the first to stock the sought-after book meant a fortune from the wealthier merchants. 

Observing the square, he noticed the Imperial guards making preparations for yet another execution. It had been unusual lately. Punishments that usually involved banishments for thieves and bandits had turned into a series of executions over the past weeks. Something significant seemed to be unfolding, though he couldn't quite grasp the situation's essence. The executed individuals didn't share a common background or noticeable trait; they appeared entirely random. This raised suspicions that there was more to the story than met the eye.


It was equally odd that such large-scale executions hadn't been communicated to the other guilds. As a representative of the learning guild, he should have been aware of any such gatherings. Of course, now it was only a play for the gallery, with no purpose rather then to still use the traditions. The lack of summoning still puzzled him. These are indeed strange times, he reflected. Just yesterday, someone purchased the book about the statue, the mysteries and myth-book, that have been with him for years


As the day concluded at the square, it hadn't been remarkable, but he managed to sell a few books. Now, he faced the task of packing up everything and transporting it back to his store. Thankfully, his shop was conveniently located near the square, making the journey with his trolley relatively straightforward. 

Upon returning to his store, he positioned each crate near the door, ready for his next trip to the square. He made it a practice to go there every third day. 

His shop was also his home, a sizable room filled with numerous shelves overflowing with books. A small corner was dedicated to a kitchen area. After setting a pot on the stove that he'd prepared in the morning, he settled by the central fireplace. Its strategic placement ensured efficient heating throughout the shop. Engaging in his routine, he grabbed a book and began reading, as he often did.

Restlessness consumed him as he grappled with the enigma of the executions. Why were the Imperials resorting to these executions? The question gnawed at his thoughts, demanding more and more of his focus. The urge to find connections between the victims grew stronger. 

He sat up and embarked on his customary stroll through the shop—an activity he used for contemplation and mental clarity. His right hand grazed the spines of the books on the shelf as he walked, mentally reciting their titles. 

After his fourth round, three names echoed in his mind, names that had been called during the executions: Kalacan, Surtek, and Tarstian. No apparent commonalities tied them together. Kalacan seemed Western in origin, while Surtek likely hailed from the northern village of Surtafe. Tarstian remained a mystery to him. What could possibly connect these disparate names? 

On his final circuit, he paused by a row of ten hefty books titled "The Family Lines of the Empire." "I suppose I have to start somewhere," he thought aloud, realizing he had a pot brewing in the background. "Luckily, I've already got something simmering"

The volumes were far from organized. Names and locations were described in a chaotic, convoluted manner, rendering the books themselves a perplexing maze of contradictions. Yet, this wasn't his first encounter with these books. He would routinely scour them, seeking any mention of his bookshop's customers. This process often took days, painstakingly sifting through the convoluted text. More often than not, he failed to find the names, presumably because the families were not significant enough to be recorded. Therefore, his expectations weren't particularly high regarding the three names of the executed individuals.

Savoring a delicious bowl of fish stew, he methodically turned the pages of the books. The extensive use of these volumes was evident from the numerous stains and signs of wear on the pages—a testament to the countless nights spent poring over their contents.

For three nights, he combed through the pages while enjoying his stew. One of the advantages of his solitude was that a cooked meal could last for several days. He had never managed to find someone to share his life, someone who could understand and appreciate his love for books. While others pursued romantic interests, he chased stories and fantasies, page by page.

To his surprise, on the third evening, he stumbled upon two of the names. As he had suspected, Kalacan hailed from a western region but held a lineage that extended directly to the capital area. Surtek wasn't from Surtafe, but rather a small village with a coincidentally similar name located to the east of the capital. However, he couldn't locate any information about Tarstian. Two out of three names found was quite unusual to find. Perhaps, if there were more executions the following day while he was at the square, he would take note of any additional names. The mere act of discovering these names had ignited his curiosity.


After dinner, both of them retired to their respective rooms. Her sister was probably off to enjoy some playtime, while she needed to strategize for the next day's fishing trip. The meticulous planning and organization required for each expedition was extensive. Although luck had favored them recently, she was keen on securing a good spot for the next fishing stream to build a buffer.

Ascending the stairs, she settled down by her study. Not many on the fisherboats could claim to have a study, if any at all. Their house was an anomaly, just as their circumstances were. However, she wasn't entirely certain if it was truly their house. The scribe who visited their apartment a year ago had been cryptic. From what she grasped, a relative owned the house, and this relative had written the scribe a letter permitting them to occupy it while it was vacant. Who this relative was and their whereabouts remained unknown to her.

The house was sizable, spanning at least three floors. They made use of the upper two while the ground floor remained locked, secured with a massive lock. She suspected that there might be a cellar, based on its appearance from the outside. Yet, the specifics of what lay within the ground floor—or the supposed cellar—remained a mystery.

In typical circumstances, two young girls dwelling in such a grand residence would attract unwanted attention. They were vulnerable to individuals who saw them as easy prey. However, there was one detail that kept the house safe—a conspicuous sign indicating its protection by the Imperial. And not just any Imperial force, but the Guild of Purity. Nobody in their right mind would dare intrude into such a marked house. Despite the security it offered, an uneasy feeling gnawed at her. The Guild of Purity was an association she wanted no dealings with.


"We're going!" the Commander's voice rang out. Finally, he thought. This had been an utter waste of time. The man had entered the Deathhall a week ago; they could've gone the next day.


Within the guild hall, the regiment came to a halt as they were confronted by the higher-ranking Commander. "Where have you been?" he snapped, his anger evident. "We were on a mission that came from higher up," the Commander replied, observing the shift from anger to worry on the higher-ranking officer's face. "To my office," the higher-ranking Commander ordered, his voice lowered. The Commander followed suit.


With the regiment disbanded, he made his way to the bunk bed, finally able to rest his head on something soft. His friend settled onto the bed opposite him. "Something's off," his friend observed. "How so?" he inquired. "Didn't you notice? The higher-ranking Commander didn't know where we'd been. Orders always flow down the proper chain. It's as though our mission was concealed from the upper echelons of the guild. There's no way the guild master would disregard the higher-ranking Commander like that. The guild adheres to protocol."


"Hmm, you're right. That does seem odd. But hey, can you fret over that over there while I rest my eyes?" he quipped. His friend sighed. "Sure thing. Sometimes I wonder why I bother talking to you." "Mutual feelings," he retorted, turning his head and drifting into sleep.
