Group XP or Reputation Points: Track the party’s cooperative success (e.g. surviving battles together, etc). When they reach certain milestones, reward them with shared abilities, upgrades to their collective reputation.

Group Skills: Introduce skills that improve as the party works together, like Tactics (for combat bonuses) or Survival (for navigating difficult terrain as a group). These skills improve based on the group’s successes.

Group Milestones: After completing major challenges, the party could earn special shared bonuses, such as increased combat efficiency, bonuses to social interactions when they are together.

## Attempt at putting it into practice:
### Exploration Skill
#### Description
Each time the party moves into a new hex, one player can roll a d4, and add the result to this skill's points.
#### Levels
The party starts at level 0. Points required for each level:
**Level 1**: 10
**Level 2**: 30
**Level 3**: 60
**Level 4**: 100
**Level 5**: 150
#### Rewards
Every time the party moves into a new hex, they roll a Track check to see if they move in their desired direction. They may chose to roll a number of d4's up to this skill level (so 1d4 if level 1, 5d4 if level 5) and add that to their Track skill percentage. (So, if their Track is 50%, and they roll 2d4s getting a result of 5 total, their Track skill is 55% for that check).
