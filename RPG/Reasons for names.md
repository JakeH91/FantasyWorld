I used sami-language as inspiration: 

Vuosarcuoda: one of the most widely spoken Sami languages, the word for "sturdy" is "vuosárvuođa."
and the word for "hard" is "čuođi."
"Vuosárčuođa." This combines "vuosárvuođa" for sturdy and "čuođi" for hard

"Sturrojavri." : "Javri" is the Northern Sami word for lake. Combining "sturro" for great and "javri" for lake

"Mörkamátki": This combines "mörka" for dark and "mátki" which can imply depth, journey, or path in some Sami languages.


"Gávdno" suggests being surrounded or enclosed



Tievarri: "Tievrra" refers to a tower or a tall structure, while "várri" can suggest observation, watchfulness, or guarding in some Sami languages.
