1. Forest Hex-Crawl Mechanics 
   In a dense forest, players face obstacles such as dense undergrowth, wild animals, and changing weather. Here's a simple structure: 
	1. Movement The forest has various areas: dense woods, clearings, streams, and thickets. Movement speed is reduced compared to open terrain. Each hex can take between 4-8 hours to traverse, depending on obstacles.
	2. Navigation Check: Every time the party enters a new hex, they make a Navigation or Survival roll. Failure means they might get lost (moving into a random hex).
	3. Hex Features Randomly determine whether a hex has a special feature or encounter. Use a 1d6 roll.
		1. Encounter (Animal, creature, bandits, etc.) 
		2. Dangerous terrain (steep ravine, thorns, unstable ground) 
		3. River/stream crossing 
		4. Clearing (safe rest spot) 
		5. Ancient ruin (optional story-driven feature)
		6. Natural resource (herbs, fruit, etc.)
2. Forest Encounter Table
   Encounters are a core part of exploration. You can include wildlife, mystical creatures, and natural hazards. Roll a 1d6 to determine the type of encounter.
	   1. Wild animals (wolves, bears, or boars)
	   2. Giant insects (spiders, wasps)
	   3. Shriekgliders (your ghoul-like flying squirrels)
	   4. Mysterious forest spirits (like NÃ¸kken-inspired creatures)
	   5. Bandits or forest outlaws
	   6. Environmental hazard (falling trees, sinkholes) 
3. Survival Mechanics
   Since the forest is dense and uncharted, survival becomes essential. Players must manage their resources carefully.
   Food & Water Foraging: Once per day, players can forage for food or water. Use a Survival skill roll. Success yields enough food or water for 1-2 people.
   Hunting: The party can choose to hunt. This uses time but can result in a significant food source. A failed hunting roll might attract dangerous wildlife (use the encounter table). Shelter: Players need to rest in a safe place. Finding or creating shelter requires a roll to avoid exposure or dangerous conditions overnight. If players camp in a dangerous area (e.g., near predators), they risk a nighttime encounter (roll 1d6: on a 1-2, something dangerous appears). 
4. Weather and Environmental Hazards
   The forest can be unpredictable, and weather or natural obstacles can add challenges. Weather Roll (1d6):
	   1. Heavy rain (reduces movement, perception rolls harder)
	   2. Fog (players have difficulty navigating, Navigation rolls harder)
	   3. Strong winds (penalty to ranged combat, difficulty making camp)
	   4. Clear skies (normal movement)
	   5. Sudden cold (penalties to endurance, must find warmth)
	   6. Magical storm (optional magical effects like disorientation or hallucinations)
