#### Story Points so far: 21/08/24
- The forest, his attitude towards that may have changed
	- Used to think of it as a place to think and be free away from the noise of the town
		- It was sort of more, like, what I saw is what I believed. He was doing what is right. Was almost noble, natural, felt right. Felt familiar, felt home.
	- Now, it has a less pleasant vibe to it. The magic event kind of soured it a bit.
		- Now it's all stuff he can't explain, unnatural.
- Seeing the guy with his eyes removed.
	- Adds to this horrible feeling of the familiar being replaced with the unknown.
	- This extends to the town itself. Now there's this uncanny feeling that something is wrong. Is it unfixable? The point of no return?
- Being thrown into the "politics" of these respected families
#### General Chat
- Chat about what makes sense for his Bonds
- Potential Manias:
	- **70 - Abnormal obsession with a single thought or idea**
	- 10 - Obsession with garlic
	- 88 - compulsive nose picking
#### Meaningful Location
- Some sort of old religious site with a single tree. Ties to the origins of the town.
	- That tree has been there as long as the town has. "That tree knows stuff"
	- Sagon goes there fairly often. He lives on the outskirts of town, so whenever he is *in* town, he visits this tree.
	- The site is overgrown and old, it seems like nobody else goes there. Or at least, very rarely. And when there are others, they respect the quiet and don't speak with one another. Sagon doesn't like to go there if anyone else is there.
