#### Story Points so far: 21/08/24
- Most impactful:
	- The increased exposure to magic, and the consequences
		- The boy cutting up animals was disquieting
			- He needed some discipline, so felt justified in the force used. But maybe it was a bit too far in the humiliation route.
		- Feeling dismissed by the chief after that event (didn't feel justified)
			- Not taken seriously enough by peers
		- Later, in the pub, when you "acted" as a magic buyer
		- What happened to Rueben? Was it magic?
		- Very upset by the dream I had
		- Formed by the backstory of tragic due to magic
	- Relationship building within the group
		- Clive and Boris had their mini case together, so feel closer to them naturally
		- Sagon and Boris may have some unspoken respect

#### Meaningful Location
- The burial grounds of his son.
	- The people of Gavdno are planted as saplings to be sprouted as trees
	- He's not necessary happy when he goes there, more depressed or tired
	- It's far away from where others are, it feels secluded
	- Specific memory:
		- Had bumped into the mother of the child before they had an amicable relationship, and visited the Sapling of his child to clear his mind a little
