Profession: [[Psyche Sage]]
#### Story Points so far: 27/08/24
- Initially thought I was going to be really good with people, but after the incident at the influential household, she realises maybe Maniatis is actually not that nice, says things that are very straightforward
	- Psychology route was close to home, so was good that this mean person is a bit different to play. When I feel like saying something, I say it (but a bit careful also).
- Like the relationship with Sagon. Has been fun to gang up on Arden Beaska, it feels good to have a teammate.
- Not so afraid of people
- Definitely the moment with the exploding brain was big
	- The fact that magic can do that was surprising
	- Trying to get magic to heal my brother but that freaked me out
	- Excited because ooh magic could actually be useful
- The magic man with the syringes
	- Everything with magic kind of excites me, but have to be cautious as well
- Has heard that there is some forbidden magic that could heal the brother
- The group dynamics in general is fascinating
#### General Chat
- Very curious about the Antilla family, why do they have so much power?
- How does the brother suffer?
	- He drifts in and out of consciousness, becomes immobile
	- Is fine one day and then months of awful symptoms

#### Meaningful Location
- A clearing in the woods, close to town, wouldn't go alone anywhere far in the woods
	- Have been there with her roommate
	- Hated how quiet it was
	- Until a bunch of bird came out of nowhere, made so much noise, circled around in the area, and then left
	- Go there sometimes to privately study the trees
	- Seems to be a manmade clearing, Maniatis doesn't know yet why it's been cleared
		- Hasn't seen any natives there
	- Goes there to trap animals and feed them various plants to see if they have any magical affect on them
