#### Story Points so far: 21/08/24

- First time seeing a horrific gruesome dead body, and it's such a young girl, so sad a fate
  - Being in the woods, she's seen a lot of stuff, but this scene was very violent.
  - Any body she's seen before has been dead by surface wounds
  - This was quite unnatural, something she hasn't seen before
  - Evoked personal, reflective emotions. This could have been her in another life
- Pretty used to being called the "crazy bird lady"
  - Or, at least, she understands that it's probably just an in joke with her group
    - Particularly Ms. Maniatis and Sagon. She doesn't like them that much, yet. Her and Sagon have a bit of a rivalry, being from the same turf. She tries to be the better person.
    - Ms. Maniatis, however, she thinks is just a fucking asshole. She's just being mean.
  - Maybe people think of her as the witch in the woods or something
  - She is respected by plenty of other people
- The syringes guy! Big reaction to that!

#### General Chat

- She grew up in a pretty tough situation
- Lived in the woods her whole life
- Been brought up to look after wildlife
- Had some struggles that could have led her on a similar path to the dead woman
- Potential Manias:
  - 43 - Pathological belief that one has sinned
  - **12 - Irrational Cheerfulness**
  - 35 - Obsession to see justice done

#### Meaningful Location

- A cozy inn, [[The Cozy Inn]], that she frequents with her drinking buddy
  - Useful little shops:
    - The apothecary
    - Little market
  - Nice little wholesome part of town in the [[Commercial District]]
  - Hot chocolate, ales, pastries
- A childhood memory. I feel like I was brought up partially by this woodsman person. He became a substitute/extra parent, who made her who she is. He taught her the bird stuff. This big woodsy man, looks like a bear. The cabin where she lives used to be his, she took over as the Falconer.
  - On this day, he finally agreed to teach her all about the birds.
