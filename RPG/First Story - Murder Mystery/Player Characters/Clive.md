#### Story Points so far: 21/08/24
- Leaned a lot into Performance
	- Pretending to be people has turned out to be pretty cool
- Just an absolutely crazy first day
	- Played with magic for the first time
	- Stood in front of a very scary, serious, organised crime boss
	- Washed the shit from a child
	- Been totally thrown in the deep end.
		- He thinks it's mostly super cool
		- Been so thrown into the deep end that he might as well commit
	- Hasn't told the others about his magic use yet
#### General chat
- Using the job to further his studies and try out magic, explore the possibilities, trying to learn
- Want to explore how natives use magic for growing plants, and other uses
- Just in it for the ride
#### Meaningful Location
- His grandfather worked in a communal vegetable plot
	- People have their own plots, but they donate their surplus to the village
	- The grandfather taught Clive how to garden when he was younger
	- Remembers a time as a kid where the grandfather told him, for the first time, the "circle of life". The vegetables grow, they die, they return to the earth. It's all very spiritual. As a child, he kind of disregards the spiritual part of it, but is still very interested
	- Could be cool if the grandfather was some kind of magic user, but potentially Clive never really knew it was magic, but perhaps in hindsight, he realises he probably was a magic user.
