### Name
Vorantyrisen was taken from there, but I dont particularly like it. I do like the first humans have like a naming scheme though

The **Eidolon Envoy**, a distinguished champion of [[Delthari]] was dispatched to investigate the mysterious abandonment of the ancient human settlement in the forest. Upon arrival, she discovered signs of something far more significant than mere abandonment—a hidden resting place of an [[Ilutari]].

Realizing the implications of this discovery and acknowledging the vulnerability of her deity, **Delthari**, to the Ilutari, the Envoy became obsessed with locating and accessing this ancient site. Driven by the potential to uncover secrets that could shift the balance of power, she severed her divine connection with **Delthari**, creating a profound and unsettling rupture among the gods. This disconnection was unprecedented and deeply troubling, particularly given that the search for the Ilutari was inherently linked to **Delthari**'s own frailties.

The Envoy's actions did not go unnoticed. As she began to gather followers within the forest, her break from **Delthari** was perceived as a bold challenge to the established divine hierarchy. Her strength and resolve as a first human made this rebellion particularly alarming.

In response, the nature gods [[Marneth]] and [[Orothil]] swiftly mobilized their forces to confront the rogue champion. Through strategic cunning and the aid of infiltrators within the Envoy's ranks, they succeeded in capturing her. The primary prison that now holds the Envoy was constructed through the **Gavdno** sacrifice—a harrowing ritual that involved the sacrifice of twenty humans to create a powerful and unyielding confinement.
