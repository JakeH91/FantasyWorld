### Plan
After a recap, everyone is standing outside the [[Guardian Post]].
[[Anttila, Kati]], [[The Shaman]], and [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]] are all there discussing what just happened. Kati leaves to inform the council, the Priest approach the group to discuss more about what has happened yesterday.

Threads to follow:
- Rueben
	- Go to his cell and look at the writing, symbols etc.
		- Shaman can help them identify symbols
	- Go to his house, speak with wife
	- Go to his house, find diary and maps
- Prisoners
	- Questioning them to find out more [[The Mycelia]]
		- Could lead to the HQ. Could find out more about The Champion
		- Maybe they were hired to kidnap people (that are being sacrificed to The Champion, to destroy the dampener)

Todo:
- What are the symbols in Rueben's cell?
	- Half circles
	- Generate picture of the cell
- Write descriptions of:
	- opening scene
	- seeing the cell again
		- Include description of Shaman, Coroner, and the other prisoners
- What's in the diary? What's on the maps?
	- Drawn symbol in notebooks of magic dampener (used to defeat Champion)
### Opening
All of you are standing outside the Guardian Post, processing the events that just took place, perhaps some of you a little more traumatised than overs. The covering of grey clouds above offers down a light rain, that gently mists the dirt roads and wooden buildings surrounding you. The great tower of the Post looms above, almost seeming to scrape at the sky. You see three people heading up the steps of the Post; a young woman you know all too well from the day before, [[Anttila, Kati]], (she has a grumpy look on her face, and is shooting angry glances towards you as she ascends), an older woman that each of you recognise as [[The Shaman]] of the village (this is someone you have each known for as long as you have lived here, a well respected member of the community), and [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]]. They enter the Post.

- So you're all kind of in shock at the moment. Could you each briefly describe what's going through your minds?

After a moment, Kati exits the Post in a hurry. Glancing over at you once more with contempt in her eyes. The rain begins to fall slightly harder.
A moment more passes. The Chief exits the Post and heads towards you.

- Short discussion. Mention that:
	- it seems like something is going on in Gavdno. Something magical. 
	- The empire are sending an emissary to look into it, and have to meet them, so will be gone a couple days. 
	- Since magic seems to be in play, The Shaman has been brought in as something of an advisor, ask her anything

Eventually, they'll (hopefully) go into the cell again.

Though you'd been informed of what you now see, you still feel unprepared. Through the open door of one of the cells, you first catch a glimpse of the splattering and puddling of blood already soaking into the dark wooden floor. Hand prints seem to have splayed the blood around into half dome shapes. Several large versions of this semi-circular shape have been spread out upon the ground, and, as your eyes begin scanning the walls of the cell, you see these same gory markings all over. A few large shapes span the entire length of each wall, blood dripping down like some sadistic, crying, monotoned rainbow. From each curve, spikes flail outwards like the thorns of a crown. Within the blood patterns, you notice the same markings repeated again and again: some cleared from the blood itself, some clearly made with fingers, some with an entire hand.
Within the cell, you see The Shaman standing, jotting down something into a notebook. Upon the floor, the shape of a body, covered with a cloth. [[Bure, Edo]], the coroner, is kneeling next to the shape. In the middle cell, the hairless, scarred, man of magic sits, staring at the wall opposite his bench, unmoving. In the third cell, the two archers sit, visibly shaking.
