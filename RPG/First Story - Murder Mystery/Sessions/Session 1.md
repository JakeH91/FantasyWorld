Our players return to the [[Guardian Post]] to debrief with [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]]. They identify a few lose ends to their current cases ([[The Case of Maggie Costa]] and [[Trouble at the Sawmill]]), namely:

- Where is [[Aikio, Ruben]]?
- Have [[Costa, Maggie]]'s family been informed of her death?
- Is [[Utsi, Gunnar]] involved in Maggie's death in any way? And if not, what is he up to?

While some of the [[Guardian]]s want to find Ruben, Chief Heidi has a case she's like to push forward since it involves an important family, the Antilla's. Specifically, there is a [[Missing Person - Rauno Anttila]]. It may be nothing, but they have to do their duty for the historically significant families. Chief Heidi agrees to go and find Ruben herself, whilst asking [[Guthrif]] to let the Costa's know of the loss of Maggie.
