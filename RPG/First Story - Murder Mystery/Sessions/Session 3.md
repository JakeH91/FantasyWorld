#### Travelling through the forest
The gentle sounds of the river flowing behind you slowly become more and more muted with each step you take, deeper into the forest. The sounds are replaced by an ominous breeze, the creaking of the boughs grate against you as you feel the hairs of your arms stand to attention. The fresh smells of the lilies and grasses upon the banks are suffocated by the almost mouldy scents of mushrooms and sodden earth, and each time your foot presses against the ground you feel the dampness soak through your shoes. As you move forwards, the tree trunks grow thicker, and taller, looming over your heads like watchtowers filled with the creatures of the forest. Are those eyes flitting amongst the trees? Or just fireflies? The little moonlight still able to penetrate the canopy above is barely enough to illuminate your own hands in front of you. A screech echoes off from one side, followed by the snap of a branch. Just a bird? Perhaps. Roll Sanity.
