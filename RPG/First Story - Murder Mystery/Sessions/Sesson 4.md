### Plan
After a recap, everyone is standing outside the [[Guardian Post]].
[[Anttila, Kati]], [[The Shaman]], and [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]] are all there discussing what just happened. Kati leaves to inform the council, the Priest approach the group to discuss more about what has happened yesterday.

Threads to follow:
- Rueben
	- Go to his cell and look at the writing, symbols etc.
		- Shaman can help them identify symbols
	- Go to his house, speak with wife
	- Go to his house, find diary and maps
- Prisoners
	- Questioning them to find out more [[The Mycelia]]
		- Could lead to the HQ. Could find out more about The Champion
		- Maybe they were hired to kidnap people (that are being sacrificed to The Champion, to destroy the dampener)
