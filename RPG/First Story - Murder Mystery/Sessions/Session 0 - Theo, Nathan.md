Started off with their morning routines:

- [[Boris]] gets up, has a bit of an old man stretch. Heads to the [[Guardian Post]]
- [[Clive]] feeds his ferret. Struggles to wake up fully. Heads to the Post

They meet [[Guthrif]], who lets them know that [[Siru Sola]] has reported an issue down at the [[Sawmill]].
