Dealing with: [[Trouble at the Sawmill]]

Started off with their morning routines:

- [[Boris]] gets up, has a bit of an old man stretch. Heads to the [[Guardian Post]]
- [[Clive]] feeds his ferret. Struggles to wake up fully. Heads to the Post

They meet [[Guthrif]], who lets them know that [[Siru Sola]] has reported an issue down at the [[Sawmill]]. They head there at once. Siru greets them as they arrive, telling them she's got them to calm down, they are currently sitting in her office on a time out. She doesn't want to get any more involved with this "man stuff".

The two of them head into the office and witness an attack, with [[Ruben Aikio]] lunging at [[Frank Gaski]] with a knife. Frank successfully defends himself, and takes hold of the knife. Clive runs in and attempts to wrestle the knife from Frank, but gets cut slightly in the fumble.
Eventually, they are able to calm the men down, separating them into different rooms.

After some conversation, it is revealed that Ruben is accusing Frank of attempting to break into his house, scaring his wife in the process. Frank absolutely denies this. From what the two [[Guardian|Guardians]] can tell, they are both telling the truth. They send Frank on his way, and let Siru know that the two men should probably stop working today. She agrees to shut down the sawmill, and gives a little extra information that she and Ruben's wife, [[Marta Aikio]], have had conversations about Rubens night terrors before. The Guardians decide to head to the neighbourhood where it all happened to get to the truth of the matter.

After a quick investigation of the house, Boris discovers the splintered doorframe appears to have been damaged from a blow inside the house rather the outside. They then meet Marta, who is a lovely lady that invites them in for tea. More observation reveals a clean house with no signs of any struggle.
Marta lets them know that Ruben suffers from night terrors, and it could have just been that. Though he has never persisted with his illusions into the day before. He is usually either aware of the nightmares, or forgets them entirely. So that is strange.

However, after a chat with [[Matilda]], they learn that Ruben was seen shouting and screaming at nobody late that night/early that morning.

Case closed?
