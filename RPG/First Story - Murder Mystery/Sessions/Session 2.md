Within the wooden walls of the [[Guardian Post]], [[Arden Beaska]], [[Boris]], [[Clive]], [[Maniatis]], and [[Sagon]] stand opposite [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]]. After a somewhat heated debate concerning the fate of [[Anttila, Rauno]], the Chief takes a deep breath, and lets out a long sigh.

"Listen, I get it..."
- This kid should be punished, but if we want to keep keeping this town safe, our hands are tied. I wish it was different, hell, I tried fighting it when I first joining the [[Guardian]]s myself, but I learned pretty quickly not to push against the big families of [[Gavdno]] unless there was something serious we could charge them with. I hope we can leave it at that, for now.

- Briefly remind what's happened:
	-  [[Aikio, Ruben]] is in jail
	- Maybe we can get Rauno some training with The Priest
	- [[Costa, Maggie]] is dead, and her family are distraught. They really want us to find out how she was so easily able to get hold of that amount of Magic. "And I can't say I blame them, The Mycelia have been causing a lot more issues recently. I think it's time we found out what they're up to."
