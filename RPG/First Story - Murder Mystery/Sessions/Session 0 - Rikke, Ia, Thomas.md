Dealing with: [[The Case of Maggie Costa]]

The session starts out with a brief description from each of the players on what their morning routines look like.

- [[Thomas's Character]] takes a horse out into the nearby would to do a perimeter check, ensuring the safety of the town.
- [[Ia's Character]] feeds her birds, checks they are ok, sits down with a coffee and watches them for a while.
- [[Rikke's Character]] takes a relaxing horse ride out into the forest and lets her mind wander, before returning for a coffee.

They then all make their way to the [[Guardian Post]]. When they arrive, [[Frisk, Chief Heidi]] letâ€™s them know that there is a man round the back that has just reported a dead body. They go through to speak with him.
[[Tanner, Jeremy]] appears visibly shaken, but seems somewhat reluctant to give any more information than he needs to. He tells them where he found the body, and that's about it. He starts to feel intimidated so tries to leave, but [[Rikke's Character]] convinces him to stay. They then learn, after reassuring him that he wouldn't get into trouble, that he was looking to get a magic fix. His dealer had told him he didn't have any more of his magic left, other than the small bag he was selling to a girl that morning. He told them that he followed the dealer, saw him go into a tent down at the old [[Migration Campsite]] with some girl, and then only he left. After some time, Jeremy went to see the girl was ok and found her dead in the tent. He tells them he came straight to the [[Guardian Post]] to report what he saw. That's all he knows. He is twitchy and rubbing his arms a lot.
[[Rikke's Character]] asks him if he's able to draw what his dealer and the girl look like. He said he didn't get much of a look at the girl, but drew the dealer well enough for [[Ia's Character]] to recognise him as [[Utsi, Gunnar]], a local thug who has involved himself in petty crimes since he was young. They decided Jeremy has given them enough information and let's him on his way, saying they would be coming to check up on him at the [[Croak and Oak]] if they had any more questions.

They head off to the Campsite on horseback, and spend a bit of time getting to know each other. The others reveal to [[Ia's Character]] that she is somewhat known as the crazy bird lady of the village, which she takes some offence to. Eventually, they find the Campsite, and after a few unfruitful searches, they find the body. She is laying face up, with her feet to the door flaps and head at the other end of the tent, in a large pool of blood.
While [[Rikke's Character]] agrees to keep an eye outside, [[Thomas's Character]] and [[Ia's Character]] carefully flip over the body (being sure to wear gloves and use some scrap leather from other fallen tents around them). They both lose a small amount of Sanity as they see a giant hole in the back of this girl's head, her skull entirely empty, other than a few chunks of brain and bones, and vaguely dry, gelatinous blood. [[Rikke's Character]] asks for a small sample of the brain, stored in a small jar, for her to study later.
[[Thomas's Character]] believes he recognises the body of [[Costa, Maggie]], as he has worked with [[Costa, Davide]] before, but he keeps that knowledge to himself as he is still unsure. They wrap the body up, and then all three of them fail to Search the tent. They decide to take the body back to [[The Mortuary]] to see what they can learn.

When they arrive, they speak with [[Bure, Edo]], who tells them that he can take a look and let them know what he finds out, but that will take 30-45 minutes. Edo confirms that the girl is Maggie. The group decide to head to the [[Croak and Oak]] to ask Jeremy a few more questions, though they are also interested in trying to find [[Utsi, Gunnar]] as he seems to be the prime suspect right now in a possible murder. When they get to the tavern, Jeremy seems of an entirely different disposition, much more upbeat and happy than before. They ask him if he may have moved the body, since it was strange that the body was facing upwards when the explosion came from the back of her head. He denied it at first, but after some Intimidation he tells them everything. He tells them she obviously took too much of the magic, you only need a small amount. They realise he is high right now, and he admits to having taken the rest of her magic, and took some after their conversation at the Post earlier that day. Not long after that, the report from the coroner confirms Jeremy's beliefs.

Looks like another case solved by the [[Guardian|Guardians]].
