## Series of Events 
[[Costa, Bancu]] goes missing, the case goes untouched for over a week due to the lack of Guardian resources. His sister, [[Costa, Maggie]], struggles to deal with this mentally. She decides, for the first time in her life, to escape her misery through magic. She arranges a deal with [[Utsi, Gunnar]], a known dealer, who suggests they meet early the next morning at the Migration Campsite.
[[Tanner, Jeremy]] has been trying to buy some magic for himself, but his dealer, Gunnar, tells him they are all out of [[Mind Magic]], in fact he has just sold his last bag to a woman. He'll be delivering it the following morning.
Jeremy decides to follow Gunnar that morning, and eventually sees him head into a tent at the abandoned [[Migration Campsite]] with the woman. He then sees Gunnar leave. Inside the tent, Maggie takes too much of the magic, and her brain explodes through the back of her skull. Jeremy cautiously peers through the flaps of the tent and sees the dead lady upon the ground. He then steals the remaining magic, and immediately heads to the [[Guardian Post]] to report the body.
This is where [[Session 0 - Rikke, Ia, Thomas]] picks up.
