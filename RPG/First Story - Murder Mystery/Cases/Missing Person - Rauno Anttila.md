## Series of Events
[[Anttila, Kati]] has reported that her brother, [[Anttila, Rauno]] has been missing. Even though usually, the Guardians do not take cases of missing persons at least after some days, this has been considered unusual, as [[Anttila, Rauno]] is a teenager. In addition, Kati mention that Rauno always shows up to the breakfast, and that he is careful about that after his parents got lost in the forest, and killed.

Kati is considered an important part of the community, and the Anttila-family is considered one of the ancient families in the village. Finding Rauno is therefore considered important. 

Its here the Guardians comes into play. 

When solving, they will find Rauno near the lake, where they will feel a strong smell of shit. It is clear that Rauno has shat himself, and in fear of damaging the Anttila-name wanted to just sit there until the lakeside was clear, and he could go down to clean himself. 
## Possible Clues
- Journal: In the bookcase in Rauno's room, they could find the journal. In it, Rauno has documented a bit of what he has been up to, but not in detail. Its still vague but with references to places, especially a hill next to the lake
- Animal sacrifice:
	- There is a potential for them to find out that Rauno has not just pooped himself, but also that there is blood on this hand. This could lead to interrogation in which could lead them to finding a squirrel that have been killed and all the inside has been taken out 
	- If they find this, Rauno would admit that he has tried to experience with magic, but it has not been successful.
