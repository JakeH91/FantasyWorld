## Series of Events
[[Utsi, Gunnar]] is now on the radar of the [[Guardian|Guardians]], since it was him whom sold the magic to [[Costa, Maggie]], leading to her death. The Guardians may wish to investigate him further.

If they do so, this will be their introduction to [[The Mycelia]], the underground network of criminals in [[Gavdno]]. Gunnar wishes to remove his rivals from the standing, further securing his place as future as head of the magic division of The Mycelia. If he is questioned, he'll be willing to give some information away.

He claims to just be a low level dealer, helping those in town that wish to use magic the way their ancestors did (despite it now being illegal under the empire). He'll claim there are other dealers that just want to corrupt. He's willing to give information about a big deal going down [[Labba, Elias]] will be selling a medium amount of armour magic to some the young adults. It's happening later today across the river from the [[Croak and Oak]], in the forest.

If the players later question the youngsters, they'll learn that the Squirrel's intentions were to slay a beast, to prove themselves capable of becoming [[Hunter|Hunters]].

At the magic deal, The Mycelia will have 2 archers, [[Tanner, Jules]] and [[Harvey, Scott]], placed around the deal site, hidden. Elias will be in the centre, a short sword clearing hanging from his hip, with 3 timid looking young adults, [[Flink, Alva]], [[Sokki, Mikkel]], and [[Balto, Johan]]. [[Sokki, Mikkel]] will be the one doing the talking, making the deal. If uninterrupted, everything goes smoothly. If not, a fight may break out, with the ultimate goal of escape.
## Possible Clues
- If the players successfully **Read Person** on Gunnar, they'll discover that he's not being totally honest. He won't be willing to tell them the full truth, unless intimidated or something like that, but he will still be willing to give them the info, because "it's a win win for everyone"
- If the players successfully use **Observation**, or **Track** they will discover the 2 archers at the magic deal.
