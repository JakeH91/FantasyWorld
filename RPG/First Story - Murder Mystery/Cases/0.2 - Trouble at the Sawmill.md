Series of Events (leading up to crime being reported):
[[Ruben Aikio]] wakes in the early hours of the morning to the sounds of banging against his front door. He heads downstairs and see his neighbour and colleague, [[Frank Gaski]], attempting to smash open his door. Ruben runs outside, screaming and shouting at the neighbour, who quickly runs off. Ruben is actually hallucinating this experience, as a result of the Mind Magic taking place in and around town.
Later, as the working hour approaches, trouble breaks out at the [[Sawmill]]. Ruben attacks Frank with his fists, accusing him of attempting to break in for who knows what reason, maybe to steal his things, maybe to frighten or kidnap his wife, [[Marta Aikio]]. Frank truthfully denies this, but Ruben just won't believe what he thinks are lies. Eventually, [[Siru Sola]] gets involved, breaks up the fight, and has the two involved sit in his office while he contacts the [[Guardian]]'s via bird.
This is where [[Session 0 - Theo, Nathan]] picks up.
