This flesh-eating plant goes by many names: Choking Thicket, Wraithvine, Siren's Snare, but most people in [[Gavdno]] know it as the Grim Thistle.

#### Life Cycle
It goes through many stages of life before reaching it's more peaceful adult state. It starts off as a small vine that grows at the base of a [[Vuosarcuoda]], from which it is able to extract the chemical that gives the Vuosarcuoda it's incredible tough bark. It's first meal of flesh is extracted through the ensnaring of various small insects within it's beautiful flowers. This gives it enough strength to properly attach it's host tree. Once it takes a firm grip of the tree, it begins spreading it's lower vines out upon the ground. It twists these thin vines together to mimic the various bug and insect life of [[RPG/First Story - Murder Mystery/Places/Mörkamatki|Mörkamatki]]. It's iridescent epidermis is even able to recreate the colours of the insect with incredible accuracy, so much so that it attracts it's first prey: the small rodents of the forest. When a rodent approaches, with spring action it captures it's prey, wrapping it's vines around the body. With each success, the Grim Thistle spreads out further along the forest floor, as well as up the trunk of the tree.
This cycle continues, gradually capturing larger and larger prey, sometimes mimicking their meals, sometimes their mates. It has been rumoured that whole squads of [[Hunter|Hunters]] have been captured by some of the larger varieties.
Their end goal, the mimicry of moose, the prey of the [[Giant Badger]]. When the Giant Badger consumes this moose mimic, the Grim Thistle uses them to disperse themselves across the forest, where they will eventually consume the Giant Badger from the inside, until, upon it's death, it will sprout from the body into a large, bush-like tree which lives as traditional plantlife. It eventually disperses it's seeds to it's neighbouring Vuosarcuoda to begin the cycle again.
