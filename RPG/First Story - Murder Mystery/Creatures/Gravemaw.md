### Description
A giant sub-species of Badger native to [[Maps/Regional Maps/Mörkamatki|Mörkamatki]], the Gravemaw is not something you want to run into on a dark night. These towering beasts can reach up to 2.5 meters in shoulder height, and up to 6 meters in body length (those these dimensions are exceptionally rare), and are opportunistic hunters. Omnivorous in nature, they can feed themselves exclusively on vegetation if they must, but will rarely pass up the chance to feast on flesh. Their preferred prey are the moose of the forest, though they have been known to eat humans.
It has the usual badger-like appearance: coarse, mud-streaked fur, stocky body, muscular front limbs (though much more exaggerated). It uses it's powerful forelimbs and knife-like claws to burrow through earth like it was water, moving at almost the same speed when burrowing as when it walks. These claws can also quite easily tear through the flesh of most animals living in these woods (with the exception of the ___ ). It also uses it's jagged, serrated teeth to rip chunks of flesh from it's prey, often beginning before the creature has even died.
