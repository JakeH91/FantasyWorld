### Description
Nøkken are found hiding in bodies of water, often with their head just above the surface. Their wild, unkempt hair spreads above and around him on the waters surface. It is not known what they look like underneath the water. If you think you've seen one in the water, more often than not it was just a moss covered log (or was it). They use their deep vocals to lure victims into the water, where they drown themselves. Only after their prey have died do they take them under water to be consumed.

### Stats
POW 70

Hit Points: ???
#### Combat
Attacks per round: 1

**Siren's Call**: Each round of combat, all combatants must make a contested POW roll against the Nøkken. A loss forces them to walk towards the water, a success staps them out of their trance. If the combatant reaches the water, they hold themselves under. From then on, they get -20% to their POW rolls, and must succeed a CON roll, or take 2 damage.

Nøkken flee at the first sign of aggression, though the echoes of their song remain (rolls are no longer required, however).
