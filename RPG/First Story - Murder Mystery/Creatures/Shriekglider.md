### Description
A terrifying subspecies of flying squirrel, found exclusively in [[RPG/First Story - Murder Mystery/Places/Mörkamatki|Mörkamatki]]. Forever changed by the 100 year blight, from which the Thirstborn came, these creatures are a necrotic echo of their former selves. Their ghoulish skin, ripped and leathery, stretches taught across their skull, the numerous tears displaying the dried muscle and fractured bones beneath. What little fur remains on their body sprouts out in mangy tufts along it's spine.
Using the torn skin flaps between their skeleton arms and legs, they glide in packs to hunt their prey. Blood-curdling shrieks announce their presence, at which point it's too late. They will have surrounded their prey already. Leaping from the branches in unison, they each screech out, deafening and disorienting their targets. They descend swiftly, and sink their barbed claws and fangs into their victims, making detachment near impossible.
The virus that they share causes fast cell degeneration, and if not for the healing properties of some of the vegetation is this area, they would surely die. Even with this healing magic, their lifespans are much shorter, so they reach sexual maturity much earlier. As a result, you will often see 3 or 4 babies (in the beginning stages of decay) hanging from many of the Shriekgliders, even as they attack.

Move: 4 / 12 flying
Penalties: -10% on rolls against larger opponents
#### Combat
Attacks per Round: 1 (bite, claw)

**Maul**: with a successful bite attack, the jaws have a chance to lock onto the target, drawing blood. This will trigger the **Overwhelm** manoeuvre on the following round. The victim may escape only by injuring the animal (any successful combat).

**Overwhelm** (mnvr): as a pack, shriekgliders may assault and overwhelm an individual (foregoing attacks on multiple opponents). Due to their numbers, they roll with +1% to the attack for every shriekglider involved. Each pair of shriekgliders performing the manoeuvre deals 1 damage; thus, ten rats inflict five damage per round.

Use the profile above to represent a collective group of ten large shriekgliders. Increase the swarm’s hit points by +4 per additional ten shriekglider, and reduce these by the same
amount to account for losses. Each time an opponent wins a combat against the swarm, reduce the number of shriekgliders by one (no damage roll required), with the death of four shriekgliders
reducing the swarm’s collective hit points by one.
Multiply the number of shriekgliders in a pack by five, and use the product of these numbers as the percentage Fighting value of the pack (thus, a pack of ten shriekgliders has a Fighting skill of 50%). The pack may attack one or more targets in a single round, with the pack’s Fighting skill divided between the targets (e.g. if three targets, the Fighting value may be divided as 20% against two, and 10% against the third target).

#### Skills
**Fighting** (pack of 10) 50%, damage 1 (+1 per additional 10 shriekgliders in the swarm, to maximum of 6)
**Maul** 50%
**Overwhelm** (mnvr) 50% (25/10), damage 1 per 2 shriekgliders
Dodge 50%

**Sanity Loss**: 1/1D4
