She runs the [[Sawmill]].

Main Motivation:
- Prevent the Empire from demanding any more timber than they already do. The relationship with nature is already at a delicate balance, and should not be pushed further.

Secondary Motivations:
- Slow down production wherever possible. If they can't meet demand, well - *shrugs* - I guess they'll have to try harder next month.
- Stay away from gossip, it does her no good to get involved
