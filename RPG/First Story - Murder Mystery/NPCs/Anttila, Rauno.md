Rauno is the youngest of the Anttila siblings. As a family, it is considered one of the ancient families in the villages, and the family name has a lot of weight behind it. However, the family has slowly disappeared, and now only the two siblings, Kati and Rauno is left. 

Rauno is now 14 years old. He have started to feel the pressure of the family name. His sister is thriving, and deeply respected in the community. He has not been able to replicate this, and is considered an outsider. He feels a deep sense of shame for being difference, and not able to live up to the name. 

He has dived into the history of his family, reading a lot. Most of the time is spent looking at the books at home. 

Sometimes, he also goes to the library in the village (bit this does not his sister know) Here he walks between the trees, looking for stories of his family. Its here, he has talked to [[The Priest]] that have given him indications of the magical background of the Anttila-family

## Appearance

## Motivations

- Main: 
	- Prove his worthiness of the Anttila-name. Mostly done through the learning of magic
- Second: 
	- Get the approval of [[The Priest]]
