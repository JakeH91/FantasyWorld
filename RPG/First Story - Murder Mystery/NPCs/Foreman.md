Runs the [[Sawmill]].

Main Motivation: Prevent the Empire from demanding any more timber than they already do. The relationship with nature is already at a delicate balance, and should not be pushed further.

Secondary Motivation: Slow down production wherever possible. If they can't meet demand, well - *shrugs* - I guess they'll have to try harder next month.
