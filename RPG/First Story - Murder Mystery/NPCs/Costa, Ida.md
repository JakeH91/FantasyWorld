Owner of the [[Porrmos Taalu]], and head chef. Married to [[Costa, Davide]], with whom they have two children, [[Costa, Maggie]] (who works at the kitchen with her) and [[Costa, Bancu]].
She's a slightly larger woman, on the short side, and always busy rushing around the kitchen, plating up meals, and bossing Maggie around. Still, she's pleasant enough when she's not working.
