Married to [[Marta Aikio]]. Doesn't particularly like that the empire has moved people into his ancestors town. Agreed to work at the [[Sawmill]] on the condition that it would be 100% ran by natives. Feels a lot of resentment towards [[Frank Gaski]], since his grandfather was from the empire.

Main Motivation: Get the council to agree to a more strict definition of just how "native" you need to be to work at the Sawmill. 

Secondary Motivation: Get [[Frank Gaski]] to quit his job.
