A weasley man that works as a bartender at the [[Croak and Oak]], not much liked by many folk in town. Heâ€™s a second generation immigrant, who spends most of his money on [[Mind Magic]] as a form of escapism (he smokes it and hallucinates memories from the past, though he never remembers anything he hallucinates).
He is a thin, gangly man, with a body almost entirely devoid of muscle. He's usually wearing a sweat-stained, worn-out, white vest, which barely clings to the bones that almost penetrate the skin of his shoulders. He has a thin scruffy beard and the little hair he has left falls as long wisps from the side of his head.
