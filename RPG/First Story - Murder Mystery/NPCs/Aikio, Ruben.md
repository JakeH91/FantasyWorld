Married to [[Aikio, Marta]]. 
Spent a good chunk of his life as a [[Hunter]], but after witnessing one too many deaths, and fighting one too many beasts, it began to take it's toll on his mental health. He would get angry more often, lash out at people, even the people he was supposed to be protected. It was decided he would no longer be allowed to continue as a Hunter, which was devastating for him as it provided him with a sense of purpose.
Eventually, he agreed to work at the [[Sawmill]] on the condition that it would be 100% ran by natives (since he doesn't particularly like that the empire has moved people into his ancestors town). He feels a lot of resentment towards [[Gaski, Frank]], since his grandfather was from the empire, and the two of them have had plenty of fights during their time there these last few years.
When [[Maniatis]] moved into town, Marta saw that she was offering her services as a [[Psyche Sage]], and urged Ruben to begin seeing him. Begrudgingly, he accepted, although his animosity towards outsiders didn't make for the most friendly of encounters. Over time, he accepted her enough, though still doesn't much care for her. She has since diagnosed him with PTSD, and they have visits weekly, either at their house, or somewhere in town. Some progress has been made towards reducing the horrendous nightmares that Ruben has at night, though they have not gone entirely.
