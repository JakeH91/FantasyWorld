Mother of [[Flink, Matilda]] and [[Flink, Alva]]. Wife to [[Flink, Lucas]].

She spends most of her time at home, eating what little food the family has, or sitting out on a chair round the back, either sleeping, or hurling rocks from her slingshot at birds and other small critters that dare come into her sights.
