Magic dealer for [[The Mycelia]]. A middle aged, chubby man with expensive, badly fitted clothing. His hair covered stomach is bursting out of a linen shirt, the buttons desperately holding the back flood of flabber trying to break free. The arms of his tweed jacket barely reach past his elbows, though his arm hair is so thick you can barely see where the jacket ends and the arm begins. He wears a top hat that he must constantly push up from his eyes, partly because it's two sizes too big, partly because there are few garments in this world that could hold on against the torrent of sweat that runs down his forehead.
