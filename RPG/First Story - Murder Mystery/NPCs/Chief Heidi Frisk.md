A tall, broad shouldered woman, with thick muscular arms. A native woman, and older sister of a family of 3 girls and 2 boys. Her father died when she was young, and hence she took on a lot of responsibility to help her mother. She worked hauling logs for most of her youth, and for some years acted as a [[Ranger]] before realising that her death would leave her family in the same state that had been in when their father died. So she took a “safer” job as a [[Guardian]], and became chief of the [[Guardian Post]] very quickly (potentially due to her very intimidating physique).
She loves to help the town in any way she can, and doesn’t care for people that don’t contribute (though she will always pick up the pieces if somebody doesn’t come through for her). She has a gentle smile that would seem better suited to a sweet old lady than the behemoth that is Chief Heidi.
