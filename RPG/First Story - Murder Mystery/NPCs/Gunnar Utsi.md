As a native member of [[The Mycelia]], he acts as unsanctioned magic dealer for the residents of [[Gavdno]]. If The Empire has deemed the substance illegal, or if for any other reason it is hard to come by, he has it, and you can have it too, for a price.
In his youth, he was a member of [[The Troublesome Teenagers]], getting involved in petty crimes, theft, muggings, etc. After trying his hand at magic, and enjoying it's effects, he starting hanging out more with members of The Mycelia, until they gave him a job as a dealer. At this stage in his life, just a couple of years later, he is still pretty low level (though has made a name for himself with his charm and wit, gaining contacts all across Gavdno).

Main Motivations:
- Control the flow of magic into Gavdno. Head that division of The Mycelia

Secondary Motivations:
- Encourage others to try his wares. Turn more of Gavdno over to Magic use.
