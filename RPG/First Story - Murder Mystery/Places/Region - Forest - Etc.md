The empire stretches far and wide. It has gone through several expansions, chewing slowly more and more of the continent.

The region to the north-west, was captured not that long ago. It was a tricky military campaign, caused by the mountainous region, with many valleys in between.

The defensive positions here were strong, making it a costly and tedious when the Empire decided to expand. The end goal of this campaign was to get a hold of several important resources.

One of these resources, is the famous Vuosarcuoda. A type of tree, that grows only in the forest Mörkamatki next to the great lake, Sturrojavri. The tree is famous for its hard shell and sturdiness. Slow growing, but could reach an impressive height, that no other tree can compete with. The forest of Mörkamatki is therefore an impressive sight to see, but also mysterious, dark, and older than most people and civilizations on the continent.

Getting a hold and controlling the production of the Vuosarcuoda wood became one of the central elements of the north-eastern campaign. The species of trees are unique for the forest. Fed on the water that comes from the lake of Sturrojavri, the species has created an outer shell around its wood. Making the trees feel like rock, and almost nonflammable, and each tree being several thousand years old.

With the region and the production in control of the empire, it would revolutionize the empires wood-crafting, creating for example, one of the most impressive navies with wood from the Vousarcuoda.

Today, the region has one of the most important inland traderoutes. Because of the plenty mountain ranges around, the number of possible routes the roads could take, is limited, making it to one main road. It goes from the capital, up north, following the edge of the mountain range, until a gap in the mountains comes. However, traveling through this gap is not easy, as in it lies Mörkamatki. The empirical road have two routes here. One goes south and goes around the forest, following the outskirts of it the whole way around. On this road several villages lies. The other road, goes through the forest. Going around is the safest option by far, but also adds several weeks to the trip.  The quickest route goes straight through the forest. The forest is home to many animals and creatures, making this route difficult. The trip takes two weeks, and you are limited to one possible safe camp in the village of Gavdno. However, many takes this route exactly because how quick it is compared to the safer, south-eastern route.

A bonus on this trip, is that you end up visiting [[Gavdno]].
