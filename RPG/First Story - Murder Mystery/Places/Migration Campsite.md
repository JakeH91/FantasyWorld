The place just outside of town where people from the empire set up camp, before becoming more permanently settled. Itâ€™s essentially an area of land, around 100m by 100m (though following the natural flows of the landscape), that the natives agreed to clear out in order for the empire to erect around 500 tents, large enough to temporarily house small families. The families moved there around 100 years ago, while newer more permanent housing was built for them (from the trees that were cut down). When the last families moved out, the camps were abandoned, left behind for the forest to claim the area back. Now, trees have begun to regrow, though still sporadically for now, and none much taller than 3m high. In between these small trees, the remnants of the campsite remain. Some tents still remain upright, with their leather-skin walls still held in place. This area is now used for the more shady activities of the residents: illegal magic deals, rival fights, interrogations etc.
