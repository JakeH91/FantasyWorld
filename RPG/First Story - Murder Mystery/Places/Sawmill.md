The sawmill has been built since the Empire moved in. Part of the take over of Gavdno involved a tribute of wood every month. It began as an export of logs, but after the empire struggled to do anything with the wood (due to their inferior tools and knowledge), they decided to construct a sawmill in Gavdno, with the natives. This sawmill would be equipped with updated native technologies (developed in with the guidance of the natives), and managed by the natives (though some immigrants were permitted to work there, if they embraced the culture).
