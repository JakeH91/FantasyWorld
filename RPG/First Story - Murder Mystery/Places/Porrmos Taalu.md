Name derived from various Sami dialects for "Meal" or "Food" and "House". This is a community kitchen in which many gather for every meal of the day.
The build was led by the Hassi family, though the whole community joined in it's constructio. This was one of the first multigenerational buildings ever built in Gavdno, using the then new process of planting trees to act as the structural form of the building. For a thousand years these trees have grown, where they now act as one giant wall encasing the kitchen and dining area. Over the years, windows have been carved out of the wall with the utmost care to the trees, so light pours in from any angle, at any time of the day.
It has been owned and run by the Hassi family for it's entire history. So in recent years, when [[Ida Costa|Ida]] decided to marry an immigrant from the empire by the name of [[Davide Costa]], the change of surname (to Costa) stirred up a bit of controversy in the town. A generation has since past, and people are more accepting of it (especially since the Costa's are all such lovely people).
