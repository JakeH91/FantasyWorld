In the northeastern part of the continent, an early empire stretched across the plains. This empire was able to stabilize the region and provide structure for about 270 years.

Continuing the tradition of humans as builders, the empire constructed many ancient wonders that still stand today.

No one knows for certain why it collapsed, but some indications suggest it ended with the creation of the [[Thirstborn]] by [[The Grand Hierarch]] Vorathra, through her experiments in making humans more everlasting.
