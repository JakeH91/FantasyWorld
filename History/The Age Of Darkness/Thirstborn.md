The Thirstborn is the name given to humans who contract the disease released by the experimentation of the Grand Hierarch. The disease takes hold of a human, making them stronger and faster than normal. However, it also causes them to burn through their life energy quickly and creates an insatiable hunger. This overuse of energy severely damages the mind, causing many to lose their sense of self within a week or two. Consequently, those afflicted with the disease often die within a year or two, though there are stories of individuals who have survived for up to 11 years. The Thirstborn are linked to the Grand Hierarch, who controls them as what we can call an army, while they remain active.

The disease of the Thirstborn comes in waves, lying dormant for up to 100 years before another outbreak occurs. This resurgence creates an immediate danger from the Grand Hierarch and her Thirstborn army to the nearby regions. However, due to the limited lifespan of the Thirstborn, each wave eventually dies down.
